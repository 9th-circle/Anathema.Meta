* Check your employment contract for IP poisoning threats
* I'm broke but I don't like accepting work for free when I can avoid it. Depending on how broke I am and what you contribute I'll try to at least get you some alcohol or something.
* I'm also usually happy to help teach you some C# skills if you have the basics down.
