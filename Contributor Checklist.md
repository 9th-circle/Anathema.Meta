* If you have a day job, check your employment contract for IP poisoning threats (and don't work during company hours obviously).
* I'm broke but I don't like accepting work for free when I can avoid it. Depending on how broke I am and what you contribute I'll try to at least get you some alcohol or something.
* I'm also usually happy to help teach you some C# skills if you have the basics down.
* Keep track of the hours you spend writing it for later.
